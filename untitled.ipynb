    "Now that the model is defined, we define a train function the seq2seq model. Let's go through the code and understand its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `train(model, iterator, optimizer, criterion, clip)` takes five arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `model` is the model that will be trained.\n",
    "   - `iterator` is an iterable object that provides the training data in batches.\n",
    "   - `optimizer` is the optimization algorithm used to update the model's parameters.\n",
    "   - `criterion` is the loss function that measures the model's performance.\n",
    "   - `clip` is a value used to clip the gradients to prevent them from becoming too large during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function starts by setting the model to training mode with `model.train()`. This is necessary to enable certain layers (e.g., dropout) that behave differently during training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It initializes a variable `epoch_loss` to keep track of the accumulated loss during the epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function iterates over the training data provided by the `iterator`. Each iteration retrieves a batch of input sequences (`src`) and target sequences (`trg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The input sequences (`src`) and target sequences (`trg`) are moved to the appropriate device (e.g., GPU) using `src = src.to(device)` and `trg = trg.to(device)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The gradients of the model's parameters are cleared using `optimizer.zero_grad()` to prepare for the new batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The model is then called with `output = model(src, trg)` to obtain the model's predictions for the target sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `output` tensor has dimensions `[trg len, batch size, output dim]`. To calculate the loss, the tensor is reshaped to `[trg len - 1, batch size, output dim]` to remove the initial `<bos>` token, which is not used for calculating the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The target sequences (`trg`) are also reshaped to `[trg len - 1]` by removing the initial `<bos>` token and making it a contiguous tensor. This matches the shape of the reshaped `output` tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The loss between the reshaped `output` and `trg` tensors is calculated using the specified `criterion`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters are computed using `loss.backward()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The gradients are then clipped to a maximum value specified by `clip` using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), clip)`. This prevents the gradients from becoming too large, which can cause issues during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The optimizer's `step()` method is called to update the model's parameters using the computed gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. The current batch loss (`loss.item()`) is added to the `epoch_loss` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. After all the batches have been processed, the function returns the average loss per batch for the entire epoch, calculated as `epoch_loss / len(list(iterator))`.\n"

    "* Note: When working with PyTorch tensors that represent data, it's important to understand the conventions around representing sequences. In most cases, the rows (the first dimension) in a PyTorch tensor represent individual samples, while the columns (the second dimension) represent features or time steps in the case of sequences. When dealing with sequences in PyTorch, it's common to use functions like `pad_sequence` to ensure that all sequences have the same length. Surprisingly, the padding operation is applied along the second dimension (columns), even though sequences are typically represented in the first dimension (rows). This can be confusing at first due to the way batches of sequences are represented. In many sequence-related tasks in PyTorch, especially when working with recurrent models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, batches of sequences are usually represented with the shape [sequence_length, batch_size, feature_size], where `sequence_length` refers to the length of the longest sequence within the batch(here it is equevalent to `src_len` or `trg_len`). If we check the src tensor above, we can see that the first word of of all sentences are in the first line, the second word of all sentences are in the second line, etc. That is why the first dimension is the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When we use `pad_sequence`, it adds padding to the sequences in a batch so that they all have the same length, matching the length of the longest sequence. Since sequences are represented in the first dimension, the padding is applied along that dimension. As a result, the output tensor from `pad_sequence` will have the format [sequence_length, batch_size]. (Check the output for `src` and `trg` from the above cell.) This convention is commonly used because models like LSTMs expect the data to be in this format. However, if we're accustomed to working with more traditional tabular data in PyTorch, it can initially cause confusion. It's important to be aware of this convention to avoid potential errors and understand how to properly prepare and format sequence data for our models.\n"

    "### BLEU score metric for evaluation\n",
    "While peplexity serves as a general metric to evaluate the performance of language model in predicting the correct next token, BLEU score is helpful in evaluating the quality of the final generated translation.\n",
    "Validating the results using BLEU score is helpful when there is more than a single valid translation for a sentence as we can include many translation versions in the reference list and compare the generated translation with different versions of translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to one or more reference translations. It measures the similarity between the generated translation and the reference translations based on n-gram matching.\n",

    "The BLEU score is calculated using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - Precision measures the proportion of n-grams in the generated translation that appear in the reference translations.\n",
    "   - Precision is calculated for each n-gram order (1 to N) and then combined using a geometric mean.\n",
    "   - The precision for a particular n-gram order is calculated as:\n",
